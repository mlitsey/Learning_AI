You can explicitly specify the columns that should remain in the reshaped DataFrame with id_vars, and list which columns to convert into values with value_vars. As Dhavide demonstrated, if you don't pass a name to the values in pd.melt(), you will lose the name of your variable. You can fix this by using the value_name keyword argument.\n",

    "5   Dallas   237\n",
